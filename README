This was just a hangover from something I'd made for a demo at work.  I thought it might come in handy as a basic slideshow thing.  It's super basic and not very feature complete.  I've only tested it against jquery 1.7 and I've only looked at it in latest firefox and chrome.

The CSS is totally an exercise left up to the reader, but a basic sheet might have some stuff that looked like this:

// css

Basic usage:

Call muster() on a nodelist - each item will be assumed to be a 'slide', so you'll probably want to call it on a set of divs, sections or list items etc.

$("ol.deck li").muster({navigation: "nav a", keyevents: true, urls: false, fullheight: true});

Options: 

It has some basic options (with defaults shown):


{
	navigation: false, // if you want some navigation, just say where that is in the page.  Your anchors should match your hrefs (best for non-JS anyway)
	keyevents: true, // enabled next/back on left/right keys, and next slide on spacebar too
	urls: false, // updates the address bar, using pushState, to match the ID of the current slide element
	fullheight: true // sets the height of the slides to full port height 
}
